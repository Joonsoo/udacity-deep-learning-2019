    "Implement an RNN using PyTorch's [Module class](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/nn.html#torch.nn.Module). You may choose to use a GRU or an LSTM. To complete the RNN, you'll have to implement the following functions for the class:\n",

But it turned out that the real problem with my model was not the hyperparameters, but it was the dropout layer after FC layer. I could get very good loss after removing the dropout layer.\n",

But I didn't increase the n_layers more than 3 based on the advice given in \"Hyperparameters\" lecture(Number of Hidden Units/Layers section and RNN Hyperparameters section).\n",
    "\n",
